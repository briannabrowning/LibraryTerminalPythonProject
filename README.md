## Overview

The objective of this Python project was to develop a library management system, leveraging object-oriented principles to handle subclasses: Books and Movie, under a parent class, Media.
Incorporating intuitive user interactions, the system facilitates tasks including browsing, borrowing, and returning items, enhancing the overall library experience.

The core interaction loop is governed by the main function. Upon execution, users are prompted to input between viewing the status of books, movies, or quitting the program. Based on the user's choice, they can explore the catalog, check out items, return borrowed items, or exit the system. The main loop ensured continuous user engagement within the program until they opted to exit.
